# godoku-minigame

This minigame is the result of a university project and was part of the course "Linguistic Gaming with Python". 

The game represents a Godoku, which is the letter-based equivalent of Sudoku. The goal is to fill out all the boxes with different letters, so that no letter would repeat vertically, horizontally, or inside the same frame. Once the Godoku is solved, the interface highlights the solution word. 

Godoku minigame is based on Python and Pygame. 

Documentation for this project is only available in German.
